In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter\n\nDisplay - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well\n\nPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage\n\nSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea\n\nCamera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things\n\nBattery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast\n\nSpeakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate\n\n5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic\n\nCall quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled\n\nSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Dhiraj', 'title': 'Excellent phone', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 3 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'null', 'review_body': 'Excellent phone at this price range.'}, {'name': 'Anantha Krishnan', 'title': 'A good choice for upgrade', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 27 February 2022', 'product_category_purchased': 'Size: 6GB RAM, 128GB StorageColour: Bahamas Blue', 'review_body': 'Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:\n\nPros:\n- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed\n- Smooth performance and display\n- Comparatively compact and light weight\n- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)\n- Design and color is neat\n\nCons:\n- Speaker isn\'t great\n- Camera is okayish\n- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now\n\nDetailed:\n- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.\n- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.\n- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can\'t be uninstalled). Didn\'t find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo\'s ColorOS.\n- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven\'t noticed any heating afterwards.\n- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.\n- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven\'t tested much low light or night photography.\n- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).\n\nOverall it\'s a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.\nRead more'}]","OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G (Bahamas Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","65W SUPERVOOC – Accelerated charge velocity shall rocket the 4500mAh battery to a day's power in 15 minutes.

I’m impressed with sound quality, battery life and ease of use of the wireless bands. They are perfect for listening to music, podcast and calls on the go.\n\nThe sound quality of these earphones is very good, especially for the price. The earphones can handle a variety of genres, from rock to pop to classical. They also have a customizable bass feature with the earphones app, which lets you adjust the bass level to your preference.\n\nThe comfort of these earphones is also very good. They are lightweight, and the ear pads are soft and cushiony. They fit snugly on my ears, but cause discomfort after long sessions. They also have a speed charge feature, which gives you good playtime with just 10 minutes of charging. The battery life is amazing, as they can last up to 28 hours on a single charge. The headphones also have a built-in microphone, which works well for calls and voice commands. The buttons are easy to access and control the volume, playback, and calls.\n\nThe only drawbacks of these earphones are that they don’t have active noise cancellation applicable on iPhone. However, these are minor issues, and they don’t affect the overall performance and value of these earphones. They are still very good at blocking out most of the ambient noise.\n\nI would highly recommend these headphones to anyone who is looking for a pair of wireless earphones that offer great sound quality, comfort, battery life, and features for a reasonable price. They are suitable for casual and everyday use, and they can handle any kind of music or content. They are one of the best earphones I have ever owned, and I give them a 4.0-star rating out of 5.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Vishal', 'title': 'READ IT AND THEN BUY', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 March 2023', 'product_category_purchased': 'Model name: OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2Colour: Black', 'review_body': 'There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.\n\nThe earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.\nPairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.\n\nYou get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.\n\nThe OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.\n\nAs for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.\nIf you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.\n\nThat said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.\n\nThe OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.\n\nThey come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.\nThe Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Amazon Customer', 'title': 'Good neckband', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 14 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Model name: BWZ-2 ANCColour: Booming Black', 'review_body': 'The neckband could be more sturdy of harder material.

The 12.4 mm drivers deliver bombastic bass that adds depth and richness to my music. I have tried a variety of genres, from pop to hip-hop to classical, and these earphones have handled them all with ease. The vocals are clear and the instrumentals are well-balanced, creating an immersive listening experience.\n\nThe wireless feature is a game changer for me. I no longer have to deal with tangled wires or worry about accidentally pulling the earphones out of my ears. The Bluetooth connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any interruptions or dropouts while listening to music or taking calls.\n\nAnother impressive feature is the quick charge. With just 10 minutes of charging, I can get up to 20 hours of music playback, which is perfect for those times when I forget to charge them overnight. The battery life itself is also impressive, with up to 30 hours of music playback on a full charge.\n\nThe design of the earphones is sleek and comfortable. They fit securely in my ears and do not cause any discomfort even after extended use. The mic also works well, allowing me to take calls without having to take off the earphones.\n\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the packaging. The earphones come with a stylish and compact carrying case, making it easy to bring them with me on-the-go. The Jazz Green color is also a nice touch, adding a pop of color to my accessories.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones.

In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter\n\nDisplay - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well\n\nPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage\n\nSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea\n\nCamera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things\n\nBattery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast\n\nSpeakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate\n\n5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic\n\nCall quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled\n\nSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Dhiraj', 'title': 'Excellent phone', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 3 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'null', 'review_body': 'Excellent phone at this price range.'}, {'name': 'Anantha Krishnan', 'title': 'A good choice for upgrade', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 27 February 2022', 'product_category_purchased': 'Size: 6GB RAM, 128GB StorageColour: Bahamas Blue', 'review_body': 'Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:\n\nPros:\n- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed\n- Smooth performance and display\n- Comparatively compact and light weight\n- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)\n- Design and color is neat\n\nCons:\n- Speaker isn\'t great\n- Camera is okayish\n- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now\n\nDetailed:\n- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.\n- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.\n- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can\'t be uninstalled). Didn\'t find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo\'s ColorOS.\n- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven\'t noticed any heating afterwards.\n- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.\n- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven\'t tested much low light or night photography.\n- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).\n\nOverall it\'s a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.\nRead more'}]","OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G (Bahamas Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","65W SUPERVOOC – Accelerated charge velocity shall rocket the 4500mAh battery to a day's power in 15 minutes.

The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.\n3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.\n4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.\n5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.\n6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .\n7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .\n\nPROS-\n1. the sound quality and the bass are great .\n2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.\n3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.\n4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.\n5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.\n6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.\n7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.\n8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .\n\nOverall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Supraja nayudu', 'title': 'Using since 13months', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 23 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Bold BlackStyle Name: Without ANC', 'review_body': ""I am using this for since 13 months, Initial momths it worked well, everything was fine but right now i feel the battery is getting weaker and it is always getting disconnect and the right earphone is not fitting into its pod, it keeps popping back but it is getting charged.

In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter\n\nDisplay - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well\n\nPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod .

For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage\n\nSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea\n\nCamera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things\n\nBattery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast\n\nSpeakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate\n\n5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic\n\nCall quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled\n\nSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Dhiraj', 'title': 'Excellent phone', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 3 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'null', 'review_body': 'Excellent phone at this price range.'}, {'name': 'Anantha Krishnan', 'title': 'A good choice for upgrade', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 27 February 2022', 'product_category_purchased': 'Size: 6GB RAM, 128GB StorageColour: Bahamas Blue', 'review_body': 'Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:\n\nPros:\n- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed\n- Smooth performance and display\n- Comparatively compact and light weight\n- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)\n- Design and color is neat\n\nCons:\n- Speaker isn\'t great\n- Camera is okayish\n- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now\n\nDetailed:\n- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.\n- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.\n- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can\'t be uninstalled). Didn\'t find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo\'s ColorOS.\n- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven\'t noticed any heating afterwards.\n- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.\n- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven\'t tested much low light or night photography.\n- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).\n\nOverall it\'s a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.\nRead more'}]","OnePlus Nord CE 2 5G (Bahamas Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","65W SUPERVOOC – Accelerated charge velocity shall rocket the 4500mAh battery to a day's power in 15 minutes.

Overall, this is an average choice for those looking for affordable wireless earbuds.\n\nStarting with the positives, the sound quality of these earbuds is quite good. The audio is clear and balanced, with decent bass. I enjoyed listening to music and watching videos with these earbuds, as they provided an immersive experience.\n\nThe battery life is another positive aspect of the boAt Airdopes Atom 81. The earbuds themselves can last for around 4-5 hours on a single charge, which is decent for their price range. The charging case also provides additional battery life, allowing for multiple charges on the go.\n\nIn terms of design, the earbuds are compact and lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods. They fit securely in my ears and didn't fall out during activities like jogging or workouts. The touch controls on the earbuds are also easy to use and responsive.\n\nHowever, there are a few downsides to consider. Firstly, the connectivity of these earbuds can be a bit inconsistent. I experienced occasional dropouts and interruptions in the audio, especially when moving around or being in crowded areas. This can be frustrating at times.\n\nAnother drawback is the lack of noise cancellation or isolation. These earbuds do not provide any significant noise reduction, so external sounds can still be heard while using them. This can be a disadvantage for those who prefer a more immersive and isolated listening experience.\n\nAdditionally, the build quality of the charging case feels a bit flimsy. It doesn't have a premium feel and may not withstand rough handling or accidental drops.\n\nOverall the boAt Airdopes Atom 81 True Wireless Earbuds are a decent option for those on a budget. They offer good sound quality, decent battery life, and a comfortable fit. However, the connectivity issues, lack of noise isolation, and average build quality of the charging case are factors to consider. If you're willing to compromise on these aspects, these earbuds can be a suitable choice for everyday use.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Rekha jaiswal', 'title': 'Good product !!', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 13 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Opal BlackPattern Name: Earbuds', 'review_body': 'Reviwe after 2 months ,,,\nSound quality is good !!

Yes, 1st set already stopped working within 1 year, so let's divide it into pros and cons: 1) Pros i. You get a good boat signature sound not so loud and very heavy bass very soothing for the ears and this is the only main reason why I buy it again. ii. I prefer the design of earbuds without rubber or in ear design it fits well in my ears. iii. Budget-friendly actually sometimes at sale available at 800rs.\n2)Cons i. As I told you earlier one earbud stopped working within 1 year so it didn't last so long. ii. The build quality is not that really good. iii. I also face bad experience at service centre so if its not working then the physical state of the product should be intact then only they provide service. iv.

This is only suitable for indoor use, at least for me, because if you use this outdoor the buds might fall off and may get lost.\n- Call quality is excellent for the price range. Noise cancellation can remove most of the background noises and focus on our voice in scenarios like a song playing through laptop speakers, filling a bucket of water, ceiling fan at full speed and typing noise to an extent.\n- However music quality is only average, It has good treble (high tones) but bass is very bad. Even at 50 percentage volume we can hear distortions on bassy sounds. But I purchased this for calls so it is ok for me.\n- Battery life is good, I used it to listen to music for a maximum of 2 hours at around 40 to 50 percent volume and the remaining battery of the earbuds were at 50 percentage. So I assume the buds alone could give about 4 hrs in a single charge without the case.\n- Range is not that great when there are walls in between. It can hardly pass 1 room with a wall in between which is like 10 meters in total, but you can always carry the phone in your hands or pocket.\n- Look, touch and feel is not premium. It feels plastic and cheap. But for the price point of ₹999 I think it is expected.\n- The mic didn't work for me in Ubuntu 22.04. I mean the Hands free profile is not working in Ubuntu, you cannot see this mic in the list of input devices. So the mic of this buds do not work out of the box in Ubuntu, I could not get it to working even with some tinkering.\n- The buds are totally splash proof or water resistant. It can be washed on tap water. When its wet the sound will be distorted but when it dries the sound will become normal, however it cannot or must not be immersed in water (I have not tried it). I took a bath with this on and I also wash it when it gets ear wax and it is still working fine.\nRead more""}]","boAt Airdopes Atom 81 TWS Earbuds with Upto 50H Playtime, Quad Mics ENx™ Tech, 13MM Drivers,Super Low Latency(50ms), ASAP™ Charge, BT v5.3(Opal Black)","Playback- Airdopes Atom 81 offer a total playtime of up to 50HRS, including up to 10HRS of playtime per earbud.

The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.\n3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.\n4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.\n5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.\n6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .\n7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .\n\nPROS-\n1. the sound quality and the bass are great .\n2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.\n3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.\n4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.\n5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.\n6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.\n7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.\n8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .\n\nOverall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Supraja nayudu', 'title': 'Using since 13months', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 23 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Bold BlackStyle Name: Without ANC', 'review_body': ""I am using this for since 13 months, Initial momths it worked well, everything was fine but right now i feel the battery is getting weaker and it is always getting disconnect and the right earphone is not fitting into its pod, it keeps popping back but it is getting charged.

I’m impressed with sound quality, battery life and ease of use of the wireless bands. They are perfect for listening to music, podcast and calls on the go.\n\nThe sound quality of these earphones is very good, especially for the price. The earphones can handle a variety of genres, from rock to pop to classical. They also have a customizable bass feature with the earphones app, which lets you adjust the bass level to your preference.\n\nThe comfort of these earphones is also very good.

They also have a speed charge feature, which gives you good playtime with just 10 minutes of charging. The battery life is amazing, as they can last up to 28 hours on a single charge. The headphones also have a built-in microphone, which works well for calls and voice commands. The buttons are easy to access and control the volume, playback, and calls.\n\nThe only drawbacks of these earphones are that they don’t have active noise cancellation applicable on iPhone.

They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.\n\nThe earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.\nPairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.\n\nYou get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.\n\nThe OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.\n\nAs for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.\nIf you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.\n\nThat said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.\n\nThe OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.\n\nThey come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.\nThe Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Amazon Customer', 'title': 'Good neckband', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 14 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Model name: BWZ-2 ANCColour: Booming Black', 'review_body': 'The neckband could be more sturdy of harder material.

The 12.4 mm drivers deliver bombastic bass that adds depth and richness to my music. I have tried a variety of genres, from pop to hip-hop to classical, and these earphones have handled them all with ease. The vocals are clear and the instrumentals are well-balanced, creating an immersive listening experience.\n\nThe wireless feature is a game changer for me. I no longer have to deal with tangled wires or worry about accidentally pulling the earphones out of my ears. The Bluetooth connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any interruptions or dropouts while listening to music or taking calls.\n\nAnother impressive feature is the quick charge. With just 10 minutes of charging, I can get up to 20 hours of music playback, which is perfect for those times when I forget to charge them overnight. The battery life itself is also impressive, with up to 30 hours of music playback on a full charge.\n\nThe design of the earphones is sleek and comfortable. They fit securely in my ears and do not cause any discomfort even after extended use. The mic also works well, allowing me to take calls without having to take off the earphones.\n\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the packaging. The earphones come with a stylish and compact carrying case, making it easy to bring them with me on-the-go. The Jazz Green color is also a nice touch, adding a pop of color to my accessories.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones.

So, without further ado the pros and the cons of the product according to me are: (** marked points are important features/downsides of this earphone)\nPros:\n**1. Sound and Bass: The sound and bass of this earbud are exceptionally good for the price. The sound and the bass can even be tuned by an EQ to suit your audio needs from your phone but in windows, I still haven't found a way to change EQ without using some third party software.\n2. Waterproof: Yes it is water proof but up to a certain water level and for a certain duration.\n3. Design: This point is debatable for this earbud because of its large upper part. Though it sits comfortably in your ear but it has a tendency to come loose due to certain jerking of the head.\n**4. Battery backup of each earbud: By far the best thing for this earbud. The battery backup is impressive. Even after using it for 6hrs at 60% volume, the battery remaining was 40%. The battery remaining percentage is shown both in mobiles as well as in windows.\n5. Codecs: It supports both SBC and AAC codecs but switching to AAC codec will rapidly deplete your phone's battery (if you are on android especially).\n6. USB C charging and digital display for remaining charge: Though it is of mere importance, but the digital display do provide an estimated percentage of charge remaining, while the LEDs used to power the display consume battery from the case. The USB C charging is a good feature though it takes around 30-45mins to charge the case fully.\n7. Bluetooth connection: The connection is pretty fast. The fast pairing is also fast and after that you just need to open the case and take out the earbud and you are all set.\n\nCons:\n1. Sound Distortion: At volume >90% you will definitely find the sound a bit distorted but this con can be overlooked as one wouldn't be using the earphone at that volume for long purposes.\n**2. Case battery backup: This is the worst part of the whole earbud. It is claimed that the case offers an additional 32hours backup, but I found that the case was only able to charge both the earphones 1 time at max before having to charge the case again. So considering it charges both the earpods once, it comes down to 16hours of additional battery backup (effectively 8 hours if you use both of them at the same time)\n3. Noise Cancellation: The earpods sounded great when I was using it in a less crowdy place (like a small room) than when used in place full of people and background noise (like travelling in a car/train/metro/bus etc). While travelling in a car, though I was using the earpod at about 90% of the maximum volume, still I could hear all outside noises and the bass and the sound of the playing song created a pandemonium.\n**4. Charging the earbuds: Though the earbuds charge rather quickly once kept inside the case, but most of the times the case fails to recognize the earbuds. This is another serious issue of this earbud. I have 2 of these earbuds (in green and blue color) and both exhibit this same characteristic. You have to recheck whether it started charging or not every time you put an earbud inside the case because there is no guarantee that the case will recognize and start charging the earbud. Also, you will have to regularly clean the charge points of the earbuds and the case because even a pinch of dust can keep the case from recognizing the earbud (None of my other earbuds exhibited this problem). Also the earbud gets extremely hot when charging. So, you shouldn't immediately start using the earbuds right after charging.\n**5.Mic: Although it has quad-mic system, I found the quality of the mic to be pretty bad. Also, you will have to speak louder for the person on the other end of the phone to actually hear you.\n6. Case discharge issue: In this case, if you start charging the headphones, almost all the time the case keeps on charging the earbuds even when the charging is complete and dissipates all it's charge. Both the earbuds I possess have this same issue.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, I would say that it is a decent buy if you are looking for an earbud under Rs1500. Considering the bass and sound it offers and also the battery of each earbud it provides, it is a value for money product.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Nidhin Kumar v b', 'title': '..', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 4 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Active BlackStyle Name: Classic', 'review_body': 'Good quality product, good sound quality and giving a bettery battery life'}, {'name': 'gaurav', 'title': 'clear sound but not better bass , good product', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Active BlackStyle Name: Classic', 'review_body': 'i love boat products , this product is good but bass is not high quality its normal , but audio quality is next level , i like this boat airdopes 121 pro tws earbuds'}, {'name': 'Amazon Customer', 'title': 'Did not meet the quality expectation', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 27 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Active BlackStyle Name: 14 hours', 'review_body': ""I used this product 3 times and every product has the same problem 'automatically gets disconnected frequently'.

The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.\n> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn\'t distort & is loud enough.\n> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)\n> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).\n> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.\n> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.\n> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output.

I refrained from buying BoAt earphones as I found them to simply be cheap Chinese copies of existing earphones that were dirt cheap and not really known for their quality. These seemed to be the best earphones under 2.5k atleast on paper, with great battery life and an array of features.\n\nBut I knew I would be sacrificing few features but at the time of purchase I did not know what they would be.\n\nUpon receiving them, the first thing that caught my attention is the build quality. These are fabulously built for the price and you cannot go wrong with these with respect to the build quality. The case is solid and the earphones, although made of glossy plastic, feel premium enough and are not too heavy when in your ear. These earphones have a comfy fit and can fit most ear sizes with the three different silicone ear tips provided. Pairing was a breeze on my iPhone, but note that the HeyMelody app does not detect these on iOS, and I had to resort to using my friends’ OnePlus phone in order to adjust the EQ, which was a HUGE bummer imo.\n\nBut the sheer quality of the sound made up for the connectivity issues. These blew my previous Sony neckband earphones out of the water! The noise isolation is satisfactory and the bass is thinly without getting too muddy. Mids and highs are beautifully balanced. But it’s not all sunshine and roses with these earbuds. They have severe connectivity issues which occur rarely but they are easily remedied by simply reconnecting the earbuds. Nonetheless, annoying to say the least. Battery life has been above average, lasting me about 6 hours on a single charge, while the case has already topped the earphones twice and hasn’t died out on me yet. The fit is pretty tight while using the small ear tips, and they haven’t fallen out of my ears even while jogging.\n\nI would recommend these earphones to students on a budget and for casual listeners, while people seeking a stable connection while listening and prefer sound quality must look elsewhere, as well as iPhone owners.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Placeholder', 'title': 'Fit, Connectivity and battery is good', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 3 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Black SlateSize: Extra Large', 'review_body': 'Great value for money product\nBattery is there minimum 10hrs for moderate usages like songs, games,calls\nDurable product as it falls rarely while jogging or exercises and fit is so perfect\nTouch is good for answering calls and switching between songs.\nBass quality so good\nNoise cancellation is also ok not bad.'}, {'name': 'francis dsouza', 'title': 'Excellent product', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Black SlateSize: Extra Large', 'review_body': 'The product is very good.

My initial reaction was that the UI sucks - and it does suck compared to the Samsung UI. But OnePlus gives far less bloat ware than Samsung does. (I was upgrading from a Samsung M21). Samsung UI is more slick though.\n\nBattery life is very good. It lasts the whole day with heavy hotspot tethering usage. With light usage and no tethering, it easily lasts 2 days.

But even though it’s an 80w charger, it does not charge my MacBook Pro.\n\nThis phone is pretty close to stock android, and is overall quite good. It has many of the smart features that come with stock android. Like live transcription, automatically copying OTPs from messages, etc.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner and face unlock are both good.\n\nThe phone does heat up a bit with heavy hotspot usage - but it’s manageable.\n\nThe hotspot wifi tethering feature was crucial for me. It works well with this phone. It has a strong 5G radio and a strong wifi radio. No complaints there.\n\nThe camera sucks. Really. Feels like the camera from 10k rupee phone.

Both front and rear Ambient light sensors are better responding.\n> 3rd party icon support has been included.\n> Spotify support in AOD has been implemented.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview 3:\n\n> Literally no change (neither improvement nor deterioration) from the Beta version.\n(Wished at least for the Ambient light sensor (front) calibration optimization, but no improvement)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview 2:\n(An incremental update to enable Jio 5G received prior to this update).\n\nNote: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.\ni.e., there were;\nNo Heating related issues.\nNo fast battery drain.\nNo change in the Charging time.\nNo annoying bugs.\nNo change in camera performance.\n\nBeta update is mostly like a Stable update.\n\nOOS 13 (Android 13) update review:\n\nDelighters:\n> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.\n> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).\n> Animations are more fluidic.\n> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)\n> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.\n> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.\n> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)\n(Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)\n> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.\n\nDisappointers:\n> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.\n> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.\n> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.\n> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.\n> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview 1:\n\nNote:\n- This review is after a month\'s usage.\n- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).\n- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.\n- N77 band is missing for 5G.\n- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.\n- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)\n- Nothing Great or Nothing worse in the unmentioned parameters.\n\nThings that are delighting;\n> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.\n> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.\n> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.\n> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands\' UI.\n> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are ""un-installable"". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.\n> Yes, the ICONIC ""Alert slider"" is present.\n\nThings that are annoying;\n> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.\n> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn\'t distort & is loud enough.\n> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)\n> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).\n> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.\n> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.\n> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.\n\n============================================================================\nRead more'}, {'name': 'ashish jangid', 'title': 'Best budget phone', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 22 December 2023', 'product_category_purchased': 'null', 'review_body': ""I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked.

The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.\n\nPerformance:\nThe iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.\n\nDisplay:\nThe 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.\n\nStorage:\nWith 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.\n\nBattery Life:\nThe battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.\n\nCamera:\nThe camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.\n\nBuild Quality:\nThe phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.\n\nValue for Money:\nConsidering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money.

Mainly I will write this review based on 4 points, build quality, charging time of powerbank, charging speed and battery backup. So let's start.\n\n1. Build Quality : The build quality of this Powerbank feels quite solid & nice. Its sandstone design texture and round edges makes its grip solid in hands & quite comfortable to hold. Before this I used to have Redmi Powerbank (20000 mAh) which in comparison to this Mi Powerbank feels little ugly in terms of design and uncomfortable to hold. Mi Powerbank feels less wider, thinner & more premium as compared to the previous one.\n\n2. Charging Time of Powerbank : The day I received this Powerbank, its LED indicators showed 2 LEDs blinking which means it had battery level between 25% to 50%. So before using it for the first time, I charged it fully using my standard 10W charger.\nOne should also note that charging time of Powerbank along with the adapter also depends on what type of cable you are using. Using an old type C cable will take more time to charge it, as current carrying capacity of the cable decreases with time due to frequent usage. Although my 10W adapter is quite old but I have a new type C cable which supports fast charging, so I charged my powerbank with this setup and it took around 8 hours to charge it fully. So you can expect to charge it from 0 to 100% in around 11-12 hours using a 10W charger. Whereas if you use a fast charger like 33 Watt, 65 Watt etc. then ofcourse the powerbank will charge at a faster rate but it will also affect the efficiency and thermals of the powerbank in a negative way in the long run, so keep that in mind.\n\n3. Charging Speed Test : I tested the charging speed provided by this powerbank using 3 different type C cables to charge my 4000 mAh mobile device. Each time I charged my device to 80% using different cables (in second case I forgot to check & it got charged up to 90%) and noted the overall time it took to charge the device. All the results are attached in order as screenshots for reference.\nIn first case, I charged it with my 2 yr old type C cable which although supports fast charging but the results were not impressive. (Time 1h 43 min Pic)\nIn second case, I charged it with a new type C cable which came with my tws earbuds but it does not supports fast charging and the results were relatively better as compared to the first case. (Time 1h 58min Pic)\nIn third case, I charged it with the type C cable which comes inside the box of this powerbank and supports fast charging, and in this case I got the most impressive results. The device got charged to 50% in just 30 min, and 80% in 1h 8min. (Time 1h 8min Pic)\nSo, it shows that the cable also plays a very important role in fast charging your device which many people ignore.\n\n4. Battery Backup : Other than the above mentioned test results I charged my mobile 3 more times but didn't noted the charging time. So all in all, till now I have charged my device to a total of 406% in 6 different rounds (80% + 94% + 80% + 44% + 82% + 31%) and still 3 LED lights of powerbank are blinking which literally amazed me considering the negative reviews I read about its battery backup before buying it.\n\nSo, overall I would say you can buy this powerbank if it suits your requirements and budget. Also if you buy this powerbank then I would suggest you to charge it fully before using it for the first time and test other things during that 7 days replacement period, so if you find any issues with it, you would be able to replace it. I used AccuBattery app to record the battery percentage & time it took to charge my phone.\n\nP.S : Will update the review in future if felt the need to do it.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Swarnendu Chattopadhyay', 'title': 'A proven product.', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 19 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: BlackSize: Pack of 1Style Name: 20000mah', 'review_body': ""It's an already proven product.

Amazon didn\'t allowed ! so here we go from box to operation (for old buddies) ; 1.receive delivery, open package ,find the product ,check its code and accept the product (and make the payment) 2.cut it with the scissor marks only (and don\'t spoil the packing, it can be used for a long time) and with the help of the two finger ,with a little care and trick, take it out. 3.Pc\'s anti virus ready for a removable drive scan, pc connected to internet for latest driver installation and automatic installation is active in device installation settings. 4 then insert it into the usb 2.0 port gently with the name SanDisk on the top. 5 within seconds \'\'the driver is installed and device is ready to use"" message appears. 6 now, antivirus scans it and hopefully its clear. 7.now check it for the errors. right click upon the sandisk/pen drive icon and go to properties at bottom and click it. my 16 gb pendrive shows capacity as 14.5gb (EFFECTIVE)! 8.move to the next section \'TOOLS\' at the top and go for the ""Check now\' (radio) button and hopefully, everything is good. 9.now the pendrive can be used for storage purposes. make at least a single folder in the pendrive,preferably. now drag any item from any location window and drop to the new folder window in the pendrive or just copy and paste. 10 additionally, in the Property box, there is also a tab \'ReadyBoost"" (wow ! my pc has checked the device and found that it can be used for ready boost! when its only USB 2.0 ! ) readyboost can really boost your system with HDD and low RAM. the box further asks you to dedicate the pendrive for readyboost or allot at least 4gb = 4096mb for the readyboost to work effectively or not to use it for readyboost at all ! if you don\'t want to use it for readyboost, just don\'t do there anything in the readyboost tab. Mind that the space you allocate for readyboost can\'t be used for storage purposes. you can use 32 gb for readyboost @ maximum on each pen drive and you can add 8 such pendrives @ max to a single Pc. 11.apart from storage and readyboost, these usb drives can also be made bootable. i mean you can also use them to install windows,etc or start a pc with them.etc, etc. Believe me installing windows,etc with pendrives is a lot faster than with a installation dvd and where pen drive\'s life is 5 year and we all know about a dvd\'s life. all the more external/ internal dvd writers life is hardly two years now a days. an external dvd writer in the price band of 1500/- to 2000/- is mostly assured of 1 year life (only TRANSCEND assures 2 year life in that price band). what we have to do is just find a suitable installer for an app .there are tools to make multiboot pendrives. RAYMOND CC is a very good search site for advance uses which is secured by NORTON and provides a lot of safe download sites which you can instantly check with VIRUS TOTAL! 12. back to our task , check the drive for ten days return period and then register it with SanDisk and get a 5 year warranty/ guarantee.13 CAUTION: dont just pullout the pendrive to detach it from Pc ! data loss may happen. always remove removable storage safely. there will be a a green lock in the \'Task Bar\' @ bottom and near the right corner of the desktop.and when you hover mouse pointer/cursor over it, it would say \'safely remove hardware\'. click it and a small box would say \'safely remove USB Mass storage device\' with the listing of removable drives. There you have to select the drive and click it. then a window will appear saying \'this device can now be safely removed from the computer\' then you have to pull it out gently. otherwise there will be a message window saying that \'the device cannot be detached\' or \'some program is still using the device\' or something like that. in that case make it sure that no program is using that for eg copying , scanning, etc. finish the process(s) , save your work, come out and again start from the green lock. if you are not able to make out where it is being used or opened, don\'t panic but also don\'t pull it out. keep on doing what you are doing save all your work and do a complete shut down and then you can detach it with no fear. additionally, as i know if you are using it for readyboost, it would not be detachable in the middle and not even try to do that ! 14. i forgot to mention that there is also a special option in the product. you can encrypt your data on it. it means you can block access to that data by other users. therefore SanDisk has put one application Executable and one guide PDF (for the use of that application) on the pen drive. that PDF is for windows users. and mac users can download guide straight from the second PDF. i think its more useful for storage purposes.

The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.\n3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.\n4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.\n5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.\n6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .\n7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .\n\nPROS-\n1. the sound quality and the bass are great .\n2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.\n3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.\n4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.\n5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.\n6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.\n7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.\n8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .\n\nOverall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions .\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Supraja nayudu', 'title': 'Using since 13months', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 23 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Bold BlackStyle Name: Without ANC', 'review_body': ""I am using this for since 13 months, Initial momths it worked well, everything was fine but right now i feel the battery is getting weaker and it is always getting disconnect and the right earphone is not fitting into its pod, it keeps popping back but it is getting charged.

The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC\n4.

As a budget-conscious consumer, I was initially skeptical about their performance, but after putting them to the test, I'm impressed with what they offer for the price.\nSound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound signature leans towards warmth, which makes them ideal for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.\nDesign and Comfort: The design of the Ptron Bassbuds is sleek and compact, with a glossy finish that gives them a premium appearance. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears and come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a comfortable fit for extended use. I appreciate the inclusion of touch controls, which are intuitive and responsive for managing playback, volume, and calls without reaching for my device.\nBattery Life: The battery life on the Ptron Bassbuds is quite impressive. On a full charge, I was able to get around 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, and the charging case provided an additional 20 hours, which is more than enough for my daily needs. The USB Type-C charging port is a welcomed addition for quicker and hassle-free charging.\nConnectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.\nCall Quality: While the sound quality for music playback is excellent, the call quality on the Ptron Bassbuds is average. Callers on the other end reported my voice to be slightly muffled, and the built-in microphone didn't provide the best noise isolation in noisy environments.\nFinal Thoughts: The Ptron Bassbuds offer exceptional value for money, providing an impressive audio experience at a budget-friendly price point. They excel in bass reproduction, making them a great choice for bass lovers. The design, comfort, and battery life are commendable, and the inclusion of touch controls is a definite plus. While the call quality could be improved, it's not a deal-breaker considering the overall package.\nIf you're on a budget and seeking a pair of wireless earbuds that deliver on sound performance and functionality, the Ptron Bassbuds are an excellent choice\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Rahul', 'title': 'If you are buying TWS earphones for the first time, you cannot go wrong with this', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 12 June 2020', 'product_category_purchased': 'null', 'review_body': ""First things first, I don't write reviews usually infact this might be my first one on amazon. if you are reading reviews on amazon and you have watched a lot of youtubers reviewing this product and you are still kind of unsure whether to buy these or not, trust me you are not the only one, i can understand your confusion and that's why i've decided to make an extra effort and write this review.\n\nAlright, so i spent a couple of days reading/watching almost all the reviews available on the internet for these earphones and finally decided to buy it and to my surprise these pair of earphones did not disappoint me at all. this is something more than i expected, sound quality is really good when it comes to TWS earphones Ptron bass buds really stand out, and please don't judge it by the price i know you might be having a lot of questions since these are priced at very lower rate and just like me you will have a lot concerns about battery and build quality and i am gonna discuss those things later but right now all i can say is Ptron has done a tremendous job here. i couldn't ask for more at this price, i am already impressed with the sound quality.\n\nnow when it comes to the design and build quality, i really the like the design of the case, its compact easy to carry in the pocket and its a bit tinier than apple airpods case but i think the plastic quality give it away, dont get me wrong though it's not like easily breakable or brittle. its just something that when you hold it and it doesnt feel premium quality but Ptron has very meticulously compensated for that in terms of design.\n\nif i talk about the battery life its quite decent, i got 3 hours of playback at 100% volume and the case can charge the earphones 3 times from 0 to 100 and the case takes 2.5 hours to get fully charged so that's doable, also there's Type-C charging port so there's nothing to dislike.\n\nhaving said that lets discuss some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1) while listening music on these earbuds fits perfectly in your ear and doesn't fall off easily.\n\n2) there is noise cancellation upto some extent which you usually expect from in-ear design earphones.\n\n3) when you will change the eartips that comes with the earphone you can actually notice a drastic difference in bass levels.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Touch sensitive buttons on the earphones might be very frustrating at first when you get the earphones, there will be a lot of accidental touches while you adjust the buds in your ears but gradually you will get the hang of it.\n\n2) Call quality is just below average you have to speak very loud so that the other person can actually hear you.\n\n3) when you get an incoming call it will speaks out the phone number of the caller instead of name which is saved.\n\nSo that's pretty much it, if you've read this far i really hope this helps you make the decision.\n\nP.S: I bought these for 1300 ₹ although the price keeps changing between 1300 and 1500.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Vishal Gupta', 'title': 'Nice earbuds worthy', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 29 December 2023', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Royal BlueSize: One sizeStyle Name: Bassbuds Duo', 'review_body': ""I have been using this earbud for a month.

On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.\n3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.\n4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.\n5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.\n6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.\n7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update are other usable smart features.\n8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.\n9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.\n10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.\n11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM..

At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.\n\nWith 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.\n\nThe highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.\n\nMoving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.\n\nIn terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.\n\nOn the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Ashwin', 'title': 'Good phone', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Shadow BlueSize: 4/64GB', 'review_body': 'Good phone under budget\nFor grandparents this phone is best\nBattery and other specifications are best'}, {'name': 'Mattjo', 'title': 'Negative Review: Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 31 July 2023', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Sea Glass GreenSize: 4/64GB', 'review_body': ""The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.\n\nCamera Performance:\nThe 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.\n\nGaming Performance:\nWhile the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.\n\nBattery Life:\nAlthough the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.\n\nDisplay:\nThe 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.\n\nSoftware and Updates:\nSamsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.\n\nPros:\n\nSuitable for parents or casual users with basic needs\nAffordable price point\nCons:\n\nSubpar camera performance in various lighting conditions\nNot suitable for high-performance gaming\nMediocre display quality\nPotential delays in major software updates\nRating: 2.5/5\nRead more""}]","Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage | Upto 8GB RAM with RAM Plus | MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core Processor | 5000 mAh Battery | 13MP Dual Camera","Powerful MediaTek Helio P35 Octa Core 2.3GHz with Android 12,One UI Core 4.1

I’m impressed with sound quality, battery life and ease of use of the wireless bands. They are perfect for listening to music, podcast and calls on the go.\n\nThe sound quality of these earphones is very good, especially for the price. The earphones can handle a variety of genres, from rock to pop to classical. They also have a customizable bass feature with the earphones app, which lets you adjust the bass level to your preference.\n\nThe comfort of these earphones is also very good. They are lightweight, and the ear pads are soft and cushiony. They fit snugly on my ears, but cause discomfort after long sessions. They also have a speed charge feature, which gives you good playtime with just 10 minutes of charging. The battery life is amazing, as they can last up to 28 hours on a single charge. The headphones also have a built-in microphone, which works well for calls and voice commands. The buttons are easy to access and control the volume, playback, and calls.\n\nThe only drawbacks of these earphones are that they don’t have active noise cancellation applicable on iPhone. However, these are minor issues, and they don’t affect the overall performance and value of these earphones. They are still very good at blocking out most of the ambient noise.\n\nI would highly recommend these headphones to anyone who is looking for a pair of wireless earphones that offer great sound quality, comfort, battery life, and features for a reasonable price. They are suitable for casual and everyday use, and they can handle any kind of music or content. They are one of the best earphones I have ever owned, and I give them a 4.0-star rating out of 5.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Vishal', 'title': 'READ IT AND THEN BUY', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 March 2023', 'product_category_purchased': 'Model name: OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2Colour: Black', 'review_body': 'There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.\n\nThe earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.\nPairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.\n\nYou get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.\n\nThe OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.\n\nAs for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.\nIf you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.\n\nThat said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.\n\nThe OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.\n\nThey come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.\nThe Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Amazon Customer', 'title': 'Good neckband', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 14 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Model name: BWZ-2 ANCColour: Booming Black', 'review_body': 'The neckband could be more sturdy of harder material.

The 12.4 mm drivers deliver bombastic bass that adds depth and richness to my music. I have tried a variety of genres, from pop to hip-hop to classical, and these earphones have handled them all with ease. The vocals are clear and the instrumentals are well-balanced, creating an immersive listening experience.\n\nThe wireless feature is a game changer for me. I no longer have to deal with tangled wires or worry about accidentally pulling the earphones out of my ears. The Bluetooth connectivity is strong and I have not experienced any interruptions or dropouts while listening to music or taking calls.\n\nAnother impressive feature is the quick charge. With just 10 minutes of charging, I can get up to 20 hours of music playback, which is perfect for those times when I forget to charge them overnight. The battery life itself is also impressive, with up to 30 hours of music playback on a full charge.\n\nThe design of the earphones is sleek and comfortable. They fit securely in my ears and do not cause any discomfort even after extended use. The mic also works well, allowing me to take calls without having to take off the earphones.\n\nI also appreciate the attention to detail in the packaging. The earphones come with a stylish and compact carrying case, making it easy to bring them with me on-the-go. The Jazz Green color is also a nice touch, adding a pop of color to my accessories.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones. They offer excellent sound quality, convenient ireless connectivity, and a long battery life, all at an affordable price. I highly recommend these earphones to anyone in the market for a high-quality and stylish pair of wireless earphones.\nRead more'}]","OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic, Bombastic Bass - 12.4 Mm Drivers, 10 Mins Charge - 20 Hrs Music, 30 Hrs Battery Life (Beam Blue)","A quick 10-minute charge delivers up to 20 hours of immersive audio playback

This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.\n\n1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.\n2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.\n3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.\n5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.\n4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?\n1 Build\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Deepa Pareek', 'title': 'A mediocre product', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Aqua BlueStyle Name: 15 Hours', 'review_body': ""The voter 550 have a very good base but it lacks in the overall quality of music.\n\nIt is not for music listening but it is good for gaming it has a low literacy mode or gaming mode can help Gamers in their gaming this has a good mic can provide good quality of sounds in games while it also have some drawbacks like the proper execution of mike is not proper because of its positioning sometime you can feel that the voice is cracking\n\nThis can we a choice for a gamer but not a regular music listener who wants to add quality to his music it can be used as a gaming product\n\nOverall it's a average product""}]","boAt Rockerz 450 Bluetooth On Ear Headphones with Mic, Upto 15 Hours Playback, 40MM Drivers, Padded Ear Cushions, Integrated Controls and Dual Modes(Luscious Black)","Playback- It provides a massive battery backup of upto 15 hours for a superior playback time.

Not only does it complement my desk setup perfectly, but the smooth surface provides an excellent glide for my mouse.

The stitched edges not only prevent fraying but also add durability, promising long-term use without any wear and tear issues.\n\nAnother aspect worth mentioning is the non-slip rubber base. This feature ensures that the mouse pad stays firmly in place, even during the most rapid movements, eliminating any frustrating slippage that can disrupt workflow or gaming.\n\nCleaning and maintenance are a breeze; a quick wipe with a damp cloth and it looks as good as new, maintaining its premium appearance over time.\n\nIn conclusion, investing in a quality mouse pad like [insert brand/model] has been a simple yet impactful upgrade to my workspace.

Let's see if it lives up to the hype.\nDesign and Build:\n* The Phoenix boasts a 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a decent resolution, offering clear visuals.\n* The metal body feels surprisingly sturdy for the price, and the IP67 water resistance allows you to take it for runs or wear it in the rain.\n* While some reviewers find the design sporty and functional, others might consider it a bit bulky.\nFeatures:\n* The standout feature is Bluetooth calling, which lets you make and receive calls directly from your wrist. This is a convenience you won't find in many smartwatches at this price point.\n* Beyond calls, it offers a suite of health and fitness trackers, including heart rate monitoring, SpO2 (blood oxygen) measurement, and multiple sports modes.\n* Sleep monitoring and stress monitoring are included as well, although their accuracy might be debated.\nBattery Life:\n* The Fire-Boltt Phoenix is advertised to last up to 5 days on a single charge, which is fairly standard. However, frequent use of features like Bluetooth calling can significantly reduce that.\nOther Considerations:\n* The companion app might not be the most intuitive, and some users report occasional syncing issues.\n* While the watch offers a wide variety of watch faces, their quality can be inconsistent.\nOverall:\nThe Fire-Boltt Phoenix BSW 194 is a solid option for budget-minded fitness enthusiasts who prioritize features like Bluetooth calling. The display is good, the build quality is decent, and the health tracking features, while not perfect, are a welcome addition. However, keep in mind the potential drawbacks like a less-than-perfect app and average battery life when making your decision.\nHere's a quick breakdown:\nPros:\n* Affordable price\n* Bluetooth calling\n* Multiple health and fitness tracking features\n* AMOLED display\nCons:\n* Bulky design (subjective)\n* App could be improved\n* Inconsistent battery life with heavy use\nIf you're looking for a feature-rich smartwatch at a great price, the Fire-Boltt Phoenix BSW 194 is a strong contender.

Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.\n1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch\n2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.\n3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.\n4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.\n5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.\n6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.\n7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.\n8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.\n9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.\n10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.\n11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.\n12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.\n\nTIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________\n\n1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.\n\n2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately\n3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.\n4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.\n\nFew other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :\n1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.\n2) Remote shutter button for camera.\n3) Call silencing option could have been added.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'MH', 'title': 'Good build quality & display. But not very smart.', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 9 August 2022', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Deep BlueStyle Name: BT Calling+AMOLED', 'review_body': ""Skipping the parts mostly covered in other reviews and sponsored yt ones, I will add few irritants and common sense disappointments I noticed since last few days of actual usage of this NOT so smart watch:\n\n1.AOD do not show date & day of week. Only shows hour and mins. No way to configure it beyond analog/digital view. It also gets turned off when you start any exercise activity like walking. So the screen goes dark when you go for a walk!\n\n2. Calory count on home screen or anywhere else only shows step counts calories but not an aggregate calories burnt through exercise activities. I.e if step cals = 100 and cycling = 90 then it will only show 100 on home screen and separate two entries in app. Its not smart enough to do the addition.\n\n3. No quick way to go to and start the activity/exercise. First press side button twice then select activites list from menu. Versus Swipe up from home screen goes to utterly useless cricket score screen instead which many even won't use. No customisation of these menu options to functionality mapping provided.\n\n4. There is no touch to wake display available on screen. This is available on my 1800 rupee, 3 yr old huwai band 4! One has to press the side button every time just to see the home screen,which is utterly inconvenient to reach to.\n\n5. There is no day/night time auto on/off configuration of AOD or 'twist to wake' provided making it irritating during sleep hours if kept on. Thus daily two times a day its a task to enable/disable these features manually.Every freaking day!\nKindly also note that there is indication, whatsoever, on AOD about the started exercise activity! So you start one, like outside walking, come home, and then after two hours discover you forgot to turn it off when you press the side button to activate the watch face screen!\n\n6. Unable to detect 20/30 mins power naps during the day time and add it to total 24 hr sleep tally. Only counts night time sleep hours that too with the average accuracy. As said before, not smart enough to do the simple math!\n\n7. Charging is fast but with even the AOD and BT calling disabled battery drains considerably in a day. Magnetic charger has its own down side e.g. gets disengaged at a minor twist tension on the charging cable.\n\n8. For activating the weather and cricket score features, user has to accept some opaque and unknown 3rd party (separate from Boat OEM opaque data privacy ones ) end user data usage policies. Without enabling GPS and/or contact/call logs access to mobile app none of these two features work. Which is very suspicious given their intended usage. Feb 23: After recent firmware update, now just to sync the data the mbl app needs gps turned on! O.w. it doesn't 'connect' to the watch over Bluetooth!\n\n9. If you remove the watch from the wrist and keep it aside, it keeps auto counting the heart rate and adds that lower count to average heart rate statistics! So to say it doesn't count the things to count and keeps counting the things not to count!\n\n10. Since installing the mobile app 'cove' I am observing rapid battery drain despite of restricting all the permissions and keeping bluetooth off. The bluetooth and sound level control functions of the phone are also randomly impaired for some unknown reasons and need phone restart to resolve.\n\n11. Sedentary remider most of the times do not get triggered when you are stationary but is notified after you start moving around!\n\n12. Cove App pushed firmware update completely wiped off all watch device setting preferences and resetting watch to all default settings, including the watch face, AOD, brightness level! The update also creepily asks to enable the gps without which it do not proceed! Now why does firmware update needs GPS??\n\nIts obvious that most of above issues/limitations can be easily fixed by software fixes and updates. But real question is do these so called dozens of smart watch chinese clone companies bother to give that much attention to details? And we know unfortunate answer to that question.\nRead more""}]","boAt Xtend Smart Watch with Alexa Built-in, 1.69” HD Display, Multiple Watch Faces, Stress Monitor, Heart & SpO2 Monitoring, 14 Sports Modes, Sleep Monitor, 5 ATM & 7 Days Battery(Charcoal Black)","Alexa- Alexa built-in Voice Assistant that sets reminders, alarms and answers questions from weather forecasts to live cricket scores at your command!

This makes it slightly difficult to insert the cable because it might widen / loosen the phone's charging port. This is not acceptable since smartphones are now delicate electronic products.\n\nBoat could have ensured the same dimensions of the Type C pin as the original cable because it would not damage the ports. So better yet, just buy the original cable. Do not rely on alternatives because they may have a tendency to be of bigger sizes which would damage your charging port which will be more expensive to replace than the price of the original cable.\n\nSecondly, even the slightest movement will stop the charging process which is really a bad sign. Warp charge of 30W is available on my phone (OnePlus Nord 1). But the moment the cable is moved with the slightest touch of my hand, the warp charge falls to regular slow charging (and i have to remove the cable and re-insert it).

At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.\n\nWith 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.\n\nThe highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.\n\nMoving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.\n\nIn terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.\n\nOn the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499.

If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.\n\nCamera Performance:\nThe 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.\n\nGaming Performance:\nWhile the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.\n\nBattery Life:\nAlthough the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.\n\nDisplay:\nThe 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.\n\nSoftware and Updates:\nSamsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.\n\nPros:\n\nSuitable for parents or casual users with basic needs\nAffordable price point\nCons:\n\nSubpar camera performance in various lighting conditions\nNot suitable for high-performance gaming\nMediocre display quality\nPotential delays in major software updates\nRating: 2.5/5\nRead more""}]","Samsung Galaxy M04 Dark Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage | Upto 8GB RAM with RAM Plus | MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core Processor | 5000 mAh Battery | 13MP Dual Camera","Powerful MediaTek Helio P35 Octa Core 2.3GHz with Android 12,One UI Core 4.1

So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........\nSo first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it’s SERVICES!!!!!\nAnd so it’s the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!\n\nAnyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!\nSo I will put an update as soon as I’m done solving my issue!!!!!\n\nFINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-\nTHEN!!!!!\nAND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT’S A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!\nBUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)\n\nAND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.\n\nSO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in\nAS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThanks to all of you who read and understand my review.\nAnd finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that “Helpful”.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Pintoo', 'title': 'Great Earphones', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 3 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Black', 'review_body': 'I got the earphones delivered on bethe next day just after shipping thanks to Amazon Prime.

My ongoing utilization of this peripheral has furnished me with a comprehensive perspective that I deem imperative to share with prospective buyers.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Logitech B170 exhibits commendable optical tracking capabilities, characterized by superior sensitivity and seamless functionality. The smooth operationality, coupled with an aesthetically pleasing texture, renders it a sophisticated peripheral in the realm of wireless mice. Furthermore, its featherlight construction enhances portability, making it a convenient accessory for individuals on the move.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to underscore a salient consideration for potential buyers — the Logitech B170 is diminutive in size. For users with larger palms, the ergonomic design may pose challenges, resulting in a potentially laborious user experience. Thus, I strongly advocate for a discerning evaluation of one's palm dimensions before contemplating the acquisition of this wireless mouse.\n\nDespite the ergonomic constraints, the Logitech B170 caters admirably to individuals with smaller palms. Its ergonomic design is tailored for optimal comfort and control in such scenarios. For those with petite hands, the Logitech B170 emerges as a commendable choice, offering a compelling amalgamation of functionality, aesthetics, and portability.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Shirsendu', 'title': 'One of my best purchase ♥️', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 14 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Pattern Name: Mouse', 'review_body': ""Writing it after 3 yrs of continuous use(purchased in 2021)\nI would say it's one of the best Bluetooth mouse available which is quite pocket friendly\nGot a decent dpi and is overall pretty smooth while using it""}, {'name': 'Nishant Kumar', 'title': 'Best wireless mouse in this price range.', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 15 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Pattern Name: Mouse', 'review_body': ""Overall performance is average, battery life is damn good.

Bought this yesterday, so haven’t used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.\n\nLooks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.\n\nIt sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.\n\nButtons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.\n\nThere is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.\n\nNow over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.\n\nOverall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Benny', 'title': 'Center click stopped working after 5-6 months', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 30 January 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Pattern Name: Mouse', 'review_body': 'Mouse is good, easy to hold, and ergonomic BUT the center-click (scroll button) stopped working after a few months, which is a bummer because I use it often to open links on new tabs in the browser.\nSo if you are a middle-click user like me, look for alternate options!'}, {'name': 'Achintya', 'title': 'Use and Throw mouse', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 8 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Pattern Name: Mouse', 'review_body': 'This mouse is good in terms of use, small, nice design, good battery life and also BT range is good.

This device is simply outstanding, and I can't imagine my life without it now.\n\nFirst and foremost, the audio quality is impressive. The speaker produces rich, clear sound that fills the room with music. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlists or asking Alexa to play the news or podcasts, the audio experience is always top-notch. The bass is deep, and the trebles are crisp, resulting in a well-balanced sound profile.\n\nThe voice recognition capabilities of Alexa are exceptional. She accurately picks up my voice commands even when I'm across the room or playing music at higher volumes. It's a joy to interact with Alexa, who responds promptly and provides useful information or performs tasks effortlessly. From setting reminders and alarms to checking the weather or controlling my smart home devices, Alexa is like a personal assistant always at my beck and call.\n\nI also appreciate the sleek and modern design of the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen. Its compact size allows it to fit seamlessly into any room without taking up too much space. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it aesthetically pleasing and blending well with my home decor.\n\nThe setup process was a breeze. It took me just a few minutes to connect the speaker to my Wi-Fi network and link it to my Amazon account. The intuitive Alexa app guided me through the process step by step, ensuring a seamless setup experience.\n\nOne feature I particularly enjoy is the integration with other smart devices. I can effortlessly control my compatible lights, thermostats, and even my TV using voice commands through Alexa. It has truly made my home smarter and more convenient.\n\nIn terms of privacy, Amazon has made great strides in addressing concerns. The ability to mute the microphone easily provides peace of mind when I don't want Alexa listening in. I appreciate the transparency and control Amazon offers in this regard.\n\nOverall, the Amazon Alexa 3rd Gen smart speaker is a phenomenal addition to any home. Its exceptional audio quality, impressive voice recognition, seamless setup process, and integration with smart devices make it a must-have device. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their daily routines and enjoy the benefits of a truly smart home assistant.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Placeholder', 'title': 'Exceptional for price range !!!

Voice recognition: REALLY really good!!!!!( sorry for overacting but trust me it’s really good )\n2. Build quality. ( really durable and good!!!)\n3. Loudness : For this compact size and my requirements it more than enough .\n4. Sound quality : The audio is really amazing the vocals are crisp and clear . The bass is really sufficient but not very much (like heavy bass) but it’s good and really good .\n\nCons :\n1. Biggest con is it always has to be connected for functioning and here in India electricity cuts quite often which is really disturbing but whenever there is electricity it works so smoothly .\n\nSo the conclusion is if you want speaker under 3000 with good sound quality you can go with this one .It Beates every other speaker in this price range for vocals and sound clarity EASILY!!!. But if you love bass and want a smart speaker that too you can go with it’s upper model which has heavy bass as well and it’s around 3000-3200 it’s price differs but not more than 3200 .

The socket distance are good enough to use standard devices simultaneously like laptop chargers and phone's power brick and many other 2 plug pins socket of home theatres or any other appliances...\nbut if your plug is different from standard design (like OnePlus power brick) then it can be pretty messy.\nAs i use my WiFi router adapter,laptop charger and phone's charger and alexa adapter simultaneously and it fits in pretty perfectly leaving very less space between the consecutive plug which feels sometimes pretty annoying for ex. like i have already inserted 2 plugs in the socket and one socket is empty between those two then in inserting a plug between them it feels little annoying and is not so easy process....\nbut yeah it all can be used simultaneously in all standard cases.\n8. Surge protection is given (don't know if it will work properly or not but it's nice to have it though it terms of satisfaction).\n9. A reddish orange sort of colour indicator is given to show it is whether on or off, which is great and is missing mostly in many other extensions of this price.\n\nCONS:\n1. The spacing between consecutive sockets should have been provided like atleast 6 to 8 mm of extra to have hassle free plug-unplug experience.\nBut still it's okay...\n2. If an usb port for charging could have been provided in the so much unnecessary leftover space in the front portion, then this will surely be a perfect extension.\n3.

These earbuds have impressed me with their sound quality, comfort, and overall performance. Allow me to share my detailed review.\n\nFirst and foremost, the sound quality delivered by these earbuds is exceptional. The audio is clear, balanced, and immersive, allowing me to truly appreciate the nuances in my favorite music. The bass is rich and punchy, while the midrange and treble frequencies are well-defined and crisp. Whether I'm listening to classical melodies or energetic rock tunes, these earbuds consistently deliver an enjoyable audio experience.\n\nComfort is another aspect where these earbuds shine. They come with a variety of ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them easy to wear for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. I appreciate that they stay securely in place, even during workouts or active movements.\n\nThe battery life of these earbuds is commendable as well. They provide a substantial playtime on a single charge, allowing for uninterrupted listening throughout the day. The charging case is compact and portable, making it convenient to carry and ensuring that the earbuds are always ready to use.\n\nOne feature I particularly appreciate is the seamless Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was effortless, and the connection remained stable without any dropouts. The wireless range is impressive, allowing me to move around without being tethered to my device. Additionally, the earbuds feature intuitive touch controls, allowing easy access to play/pause, volume adjustment, and call management.\n\nWhile the overall performance of these earbuds is exceptional, I did encounter a minor drawback. The noise isolation could be improved, especially in louder environments. Although they provide some passive noise reduction, ambient sounds can still be heard, which may affect the immersion in certain situations.\n\nIn conclusion, these earbuds have impressed me with their superior sound quality, comfort, and convenient features.

Amazon didn\'t allowed ! so here we go from box to operation (for old buddies) ; 1.receive delivery, open package ,find the product ,check its code and accept the product (and make the payment) 2.cut it with the scissor marks only (and don\'t spoil the packing, it can be used for a long time) and with the help of the two finger ,with a little care and trick, take it out. 3.Pc\'s anti virus ready for a removable drive scan, pc connected to internet for latest driver installation and automatic installation is active in device installation settings. 4 then insert it into the usb 2.0 port gently with the name SanDisk on the top. 5 within seconds \'\'the driver is installed and device is ready to use"" message appears. 6 now, antivirus scans it and hopefully its clear. 7.now check it for the errors. right click upon the sandisk/pen drive icon and go to properties at bottom and click it. my 16 gb pendrive shows capacity as 14.5gb (EFFECTIVE)! 8.move to the next section \'TOOLS\' at the top and go for the ""Check now\' (radio) button and hopefully, everything is good. 9.now the pendrive can be used for storage purposes. make at least a single folder in the pendrive,preferably. now drag any item from any location window and drop to the new folder window in the pendrive or just copy and paste. 10 additionally, in the Property box, there is also a tab \'ReadyBoost"" (wow ! my pc has checked the device and found that it can be used for ready boost! when its only USB 2.0 ! ) readyboost can really boost your system with HDD and low RAM. the box further asks you to dedicate the pendrive for readyboost or allot at least 4gb = 4096mb for the readyboost to work effectively or not to use it for readyboost at all ! if you don\'t want to use it for readyboost, just don\'t do there anything in the readyboost tab. Mind that the space you allocate for readyboost can\'t be used for storage purposes. you can use 32 gb for readyboost @ maximum on each pen drive and you can add 8 such pendrives @ max to a single Pc. 11.apart from storage and readyboost, these usb drives can also be made bootable. i mean you can also use them to install windows,etc or start a pc with them.etc, etc. Believe me installing windows,etc with pendrives is a lot faster than with a installation dvd and where pen drive\'s life is 5 year and we all know about a dvd\'s life. all the more external/ internal dvd writers life is hardly two years now a days. an external dvd writer in the price band of 1500/- to 2000/- is mostly assured of 1 year life (only TRANSCEND assures 2 year life in that price band). what we have to do is just find a suitable installer for an app .there are tools to make multiboot pendrives. RAYMOND CC is a very good search site for advance uses which is secured by NORTON and provides a lot of safe download sites which you can instantly check with VIRUS TOTAL! 12. back to our task , check the drive for ten days return period and then register it with SanDisk and get a 5 year warranty/ guarantee.13 CAUTION: dont just pullout the pendrive to detach it from Pc ! data loss may happen. always remove removable storage safely. there will be a a green lock in the \'Task Bar\' @ bottom and near the right corner of the desktop.and when you hover mouse pointer/cursor over it, it would say \'safely remove hardware\'. click it and a small box would say \'safely remove USB Mass storage device\' with the listing of removable drives. There you have to select the drive and click it. then a window will appear saying \'this device can now be safely removed from the computer\' then you have to pull it out gently. otherwise there will be a message window saying that \'the device cannot be detached\' or \'some program is still using the device\' or something like that. in that case make it sure that no program is using that for eg copying , scanning, etc. finish the process(s) , save your work, come out and again start from the green lock. if you are not able to make out where it is being used or opened, don\'t panic but also don\'t pull it out. keep on doing what you are doing save all your work and do a complete shut down and then you can detach it with no fear. additionally, as i know if you are using it for readyboost, it would not be detachable in the middle and not even try to do that ! 14. i forgot to mention that there is also a special option in the product. you can encrypt your data on it. it means you can block access to that data by other users. therefore SanDisk has put one application Executable and one guide PDF (for the use of that application) on the pen drive. that PDF is for windows users. and mac users can download guide straight from the second PDF. i think its more useful for storage purposes.

Pairing was a breeze on my iPhone, but note that the HeyMelody app does not detect these on iOS, and I had to resort to using my friends’ OnePlus phone in order to adjust the EQ, which was a HUGE bummer imo.\n\nBut the sheer quality of the sound made up for the connectivity issues. These blew my previous Sony neckband earphones out of the water! The noise isolation is satisfactory and the bass is thinly without getting too muddy. Mids and highs are beautifully balanced. But it’s not all sunshine and roses with these earbuds. They have severe connectivity issues which occur rarely but they are easily remedied by simply reconnecting the earbuds. Nonetheless, annoying to say the least. Battery life has been above average, lasting me about 6 hours on a single charge, while the case has already topped the earphones twice and hasn’t died out on me yet. The fit is pretty tight while using the small ear tips, and they haven’t fallen out of my ears even while jogging.\n\nI would recommend these earphones to students on a budget and for casual listeners, while people seeking a stable connection while listening and prefer sound quality must look elsewhere, as well as iPhone owners.\nRead more'}, {'name': 'Placeholder', 'title': 'Fit, Connectivity and battery is good', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 3 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Black SlateSize: Extra Large', 'review_body': 'Great value for money product\nBattery is there minimum 10hrs for moderate usages like songs, games,calls\nDurable product as it falls rarely while jogging or exercises and fit is so perfect\nTouch is good for answering calls and switching between songs.\nBass quality so good\nNoise cancellation is also ok not bad.'}, {'name': 'francis dsouza', 'title': 'Excellent product', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: Black SlateSize: Extra Large', 'review_body': 'The product is very good.

You'll always appreciate how this makes your life easier when you know you can get your phone charged to 50% in 10 minutes.\nI don't think I need to review the SoC which is 8gen2. It's not about how super powerful it is but how good it works in terms of efficiency and heating. Though it is start of summer only, I haven't felt gte phone heating up even once. It's like these two problems which ruined last two years Android scene are non existent this time.\nDisplay is quite capable with Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos tech, the viewing experience is as immersive as it gets at this price or may be higher.\nHaptics are awesome, you don't see (feel) haptics as good as this except iphones or pixels.\nColor OS inspired Oxygen OS is quite good and if we ignore some bugs highlighted by MKBHD. I moved from OnePlus 6 which was maybe pinnacle of OnePlus and Oxygen OS to this and I feel like it's an upgrade.\n\n4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates. Their updates are not as frequent and useful as Google but this adds to phone's overall life. You can at least get it repaired and have parts replaced in this window. I couldn't get power button replaced on my old OP6 because it was out of support.\n\nCamera is decent. It is actually competing with Samsung and iPhones and beating them in low light shots. This is change as OnePlus cameras used to be B+ which is now A- with other flagships at A+ but they also don't come this cheap except pixel. One disappointment is front facing camera. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU'RE A SELFIE LOVER and don't like Vivo and Oppo approach of making your skin look smooth and brighter. Front video is also called at 1080p which is a shame. Should have been 4k30 at least.\n\nCons - as said earlier, there are some annoying bugs/features in UI which can be easily fixed through a small update.\n\nDisplay is not brighter indoor as iphones and Samsung ultras but you won't feel if you haven't seen those.\n\nOne very apparent disadvantage vis a vis S23 is lack of Wireless charging and IP rating. These are compromises which I think ok to not have if we are getting quad HD display at this price. Although I would have preferred reverse wireless charging so I could charge my earbuds on the go.\n\nAnd last, the most beautiful thing about his phone is it comes with charger and screen guard and a phone case in the box. Appreciate this when trillion dollar companies like Google and Apple don't provide this despite charging more than 1 lakh.\n\nI hope you find this helpful. I was criticizing OnePlus and Qualcomm heavily for past two years on all platforms but this is the year they have turned it around.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Karthik Krishnamoorthy', 'title': 'Super battery', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 22 January 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'null', 'review_body': 'Amazing battery.

I already like the one UI and the perks that come with it. Now i booked S23 and then realized the fact that it is a bad deal for a phone that was already worth a lot of money. Now I' not saying this phone is also worth your hard earned money. this has its flaws and a lot of people here have already pointed out many of it . Yes the camera processing sucks(sometimes), yes the video quality is meh(compared to other flagships), yes it sucks not to have wireless charging and many flaws follow the suit.\n\nThe unit i received is working absolutely fine and has no heating issues or jittering or any thing else(physically and software wise my unit is fine till now). The phone takes just 25 mins to get to 90-100% from 20-25% charge. The screen is an E4 panel but its is damn good. The battery life (until and unless u push it really hard) is absolute top tier. I'm a person who attends office meetings through phone most of the times. this thing has an solid battery life that will last u a day and then some. The in-hand feel is good but you really have to be careful as it has a glass back that has ZERO grip. The sound is really good (quality is ok, bass is meh, loudness is 11/10) and it actually feels like stereo speakers.\n\nNow if u ask me if this phone is worth 60000, it is not. PERIOD. And u shouldn't buy 8GB version as it is a even worse deal. You can buy iPhone 13,14 or S23 if u have good exchange offer.(but then u'll have to buy a charger, back cover... all extra which i don't appreciate).\n\nI would recommend this if u have money to spend, else U can buy 11R which is actually a steal for that price.\n\nI gave 5 stars becoz the phone thts in my hands is perfectly working and is of great use to me. it hasn't shown any glitches or software issues either (no hardware issues too). i just hope this thing lasts for a couple of years and it doesn't turn to a sucker with updates coming.\nRead more""}]","OnePlus 11 5G (Eternal Green, 16GB RAM, 256GB Storage)","Camera: 50MP Main Camera with Sony IMX890 (OIS supported), 48MP Ultrawide Camera with Sony IMX581 (FOV: 115 degree) and 32MP Telephoto lens with Sony IMX709 (2X Optical Zoom); 16MP Front (Selfie) Camera with EIS support

Mainly I will write this review based on 4 points, build quality, charging time of powerbank, charging speed and battery backup. So let's start.\n\n1. Build Quality : The build quality of this Powerbank feels quite solid & nice. Its sandstone design texture and round edges makes its grip solid in hands & quite comfortable to hold. Before this I used to have Redmi Powerbank (20000 mAh) which in comparison to this Mi Powerbank feels little ugly in terms of design and uncomfortable to hold. Mi Powerbank feels less wider, thinner & more premium as compared to the previous one.\n\n2. Charging Time of Powerbank : The day I received this Powerbank, its LED indicators showed 2 LEDs blinking which means it had battery level between 25% to 50%. So before using it for the first time, I charged it fully using my standard 10W charger.\nOne should also note that charging time of Powerbank along with the adapter also depends on what type of cable you are using. Using an old type C cable will take more time to charge it, as current carrying capacity of the cable decreases with time due to frequent usage. Although my 10W adapter is quite old but I have a new type C cable which supports fast charging, so I charged my powerbank with this setup and it took around 8 hours to charge it fully. So you can expect to charge it from 0 to 100% in around 11-12 hours using a 10W charger. Whereas if you use a fast charger like 33 Watt, 65 Watt etc. then ofcourse the powerbank will charge at a faster rate but it will also affect the efficiency and thermals of the powerbank in a negative way in the long run, so keep that in mind.\n\n3. Charging Speed Test : I tested the charging speed provided by this powerbank using 3 different type C cables to charge my 4000 mAh mobile device. Each time I charged my device to 80% using different cables (in second case I forgot to check & it got charged up to 90%) and noted the overall time it took to charge the device. All the results are attached in order as screenshots for reference.\nIn first case, I charged it with my 2 yr old type C cable which although supports fast charging but the results were not impressive. (Time 1h 43 min Pic)\nIn second case, I charged it with a new type C cable which came with my tws earbuds but it does not supports fast charging and the results were relatively better as compared to the first case. (Time 1h 58min Pic)\nIn third case, I charged it with the type C cable which comes inside the box of this powerbank and supports fast charging, and in this case I got the most impressive results. The device got charged to 50% in just 30 min, and 80% in 1h 8min. (Time 1h 8min Pic)\nSo, it shows that the cable also plays a very important role in fast charging your device which many people ignore.\n\n4. Battery Backup : Other than the above mentioned test results I charged my mobile 3 more times but didn't noted the charging time. So all in all, till now I have charged my device to a total of 406% in 6 different rounds (80% + 94% + 80% + 44% + 82% + 31%) and still 3 LED lights of powerbank are blinking which literally amazed me considering the negative reviews I read about its battery backup before buying it.\n\nSo, overall I would say you can buy this powerbank if it suits your requirements and budget. Also if you buy this powerbank then I would suggest you to charge it fully before using it for the first time and test other things during that 7 days replacement period, so if you find any issues with it, you would be able to replace it. I used AccuBattery app to record the battery percentage & time it took to charge my phone.\n\nP.S : Will update the review in future if felt the need to do it.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Swarnendu Chattopadhyay', 'title': 'A proven product.', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 19 February 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Colour: BlackSize: Pack of 1Style Name: 20000mah', 'review_body': ""It's an already proven product.

The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.\n\nConnecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.\n\nOn the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.\n\nThe ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Ω and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.\n\nIt's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.\n\nIn conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Saikat Majumdar', 'title': 'Good till its warranty', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Style Name: Zeb-Bro(Black)', 'review_body': 'One of the ear piece stopped working in its sixth month from the date of purchase.

ANC is promising, just make sure you use the earbuds pieces (idk what its called) that matches your ears and you'll notice a significant difference. Transparency mode is great too. This product also supports dolby atmos and 3d spatial sound! Touch controls too, that you can configure via 'Realme link' app.\n\nAbout app:\nThe app has various configurations like battery status, sound effects mode, that include:\n1. Clear vocals- for obviously clear vocals lol\n2. Nature balance- idk what this means tbh, but from what i know, it automatically adjusts the sound depending on what is playing.\n3. Clear bass- best sound effect mode for bass lovers, not to heavy, not to light, just perfect (recommended)\n4. Bass boost- meh, i dont think think you'd want to live in a constant barrage of earthquake... its a headache (its not that strong, i think clear bass is more than enough in my opinion)\n\nIt also comes with equalizer where you add various presets and create sound profiles.\n\nSpatial Audio: let me copy paste from what it says in the app.... Brand new 360 degree immersive surround sound experience, so you you feel like you're right at the center of the action.\n\nVolume enhancer: It further increases the volume and enhance its quality. You know the meaning of enhance don't you?\n\nOther settings: Game mode\nyes, game mode it reduces latency ofcourse! that too- significantly! good for gaming 50ms latency i guess?\n\nFind my phone: finds your phone. Let me copy paste again.... When your headset is connected to your phone, press the left or right earbud four times continuously to find your phone. Your phone will then start to ring.\n\nButton settings: double tap, triple tap, touch and hold...\nactions: play/pause, previous track, switch noise control modes.... you can configure these settings with button settings! i like it\n\noverall rating: (for the price segment)\n\ncomfort: 3.6/5\n\nsound: lows: 4/5 mids: 4/5 highs: 5/5. bass: 5/5 overall: 4.5/5\n\nANC: 5/5. Best Active noise cancellation you'll get at this price right now.\n\nstereo seperation: Bad, sound is a bit inclined toward right side. I had to use the audio balance bar slider from settings to align the sound. MAYBE IT WAS MY PHONE's ISSUE? IDK\n\nlooks: small, cute, neat, and its surprisingly light weight! both colors are very good! (i have the black one) 5/5\n\ncase: premium, sturdy and good build quality, fits in palm, it wont disappoint you, open and close the case, its quite satisfying. i do that when im bored. its so cute i want to eat it. 5/5\n\nMic and calling: Nice, I really have no idea about it because i don't have anyone to talk with. Maybe look for other reviews about this?! sorry :( ?/5\n\nOVerall rating: 4.38134124/5\n\nOTHER: just go for it my friend, if you want more in this price, well goodluck waiting. You wont find better ear-pods in this price. I bet my left ball.\n\nEDIT: Yes it was my phone's issue, the stereo seperation is balanced, i checked on my brother's phone. Also, if you are going for white color then dont forget the case for the white earpods is glossy unlike black that is matte, and the white earpods material is glossier than the black one too, i have both colors. So if you're looking for matte finish then just go for black color, it looks more premium and it looks better than the white ones.\n\nThanks for reading!\n-YASH\nRead more""}, {'name': 'Asha', 'title': 'Excellent Sound quality, Good Bass, Clear sound', 'review_date': 'Reviewed in India on 5 March 2024', 'product_category_purchased': 'Style Name: Techlife Buds T100Colour: Black', 'review_body': ""I am using this tws for the past 3 months.

I have experience. When I connected this with my vivo which is a old one and don't support AAC code, the sound wasn't that much great when compared to Samsung.\n\nBut I have some issues only sometimes like one piece is working and another not.

Too loud. Mostly used it at 40% volume. Never went above it.\n\n-The fit is very comfortable and buds are light. Can easily use over long hours without any issue. Also the case itself is very handy and finish levels are excellent for the price. The case hinge has a good snap to it which I like.\n\n-The touch controls may require getting used to. The touch area itself is quit small in my opinion. Too me a week to get used to it but no major problems. Touch works fine.\n\n-Noise cancellation actually works well. Definately not a gimmick. Coupled with the seal of the eartips itself, Noice cancellation cancels out most of the white noise like fan, wind, buzz from machines, taxi noise etc.\n\n-Transparency does work. But I rarely used it. I only switched between noise cancellation ON and OFF during my use.\n\n-Battery life is really good with ANC off. Easy 3 day battery with Normal use. Battery life takes a hit with ANC or Transparency Mode ON. Expect like 1.5 to 2 day battery.\n\n-SOUND QUALITY\nLOTS OF BASS. LIKE A TON OF BASS.\nBass is punchy and precise and you are always aware of it while using the buds.\nBass was too much for me, So I set up my own EQ SETTING in the realme link app. And now it sounds excellent.\n\nThe mids and highs are equally good. The vocals are crisp and clear. The instrument seperation is also done well. Would have liked a bit wider sound stage but not a big deal given the price range of the buds.\n\nThe buds have really good hardware but may or may not require some EQ tuning depending on the person using it.\n\nThe default sound setup itself is very good but bass was a little too much for me so I created my own EQ Preset which I have attached with this review, so feel free to use it.\n\nOverall Excellent pair of earbuds with great build quality, Lots of features, and customisation options for sounds.

There are many camera features in it. You can record 4k video in 30fps and 1080p at 60fps. Video camera quality is average. Video is very much stabilized for normal use. For professional videography it has a mode named Film mode where you can customise the settings according to you and there you can have the best stabilization. You can also have the access to the iPhone cinematic mode (video bg blur) but at 720p.\nFingerprint sensor- It has under display fingerprint sensor because of the amoled display which works well all the time. I haven't faced any issue with the fingerprint sensor.\nUpdates: As you'll purchase this phone, within few days you'll receive the major Android 13 OS update which works well.
